%% This file provides the FORMAT you should use for the
%% slopes in HP2.3. x denotes the horizontal distance
%% travelled (by the truck) on a given slope, and
%% alpha measures the slope angle at distance x
%%
%% iSlope denotes the slope index (i.e. 1,2,..10 for the
%% training set etc.)
%% iDataSet determines whether the slope under consideration
%% belongs to the training set (iDataSet = 1), validation
%% set (iDataSet = 2) or the test set (iDataSet = 3).
%%
%% Note that the slopes given below are just EXAMPLES.
%% Please feel free to implement your own slopes below,
%% as long as they fulfil the criteria given in HP2.3.
%%
%% You may remove the comments above and below, as they
%% (or at least some of them) violate the coding standard 
%%  a bit. :)
%% The comments have been added as a clarification of the 
%% problem that should be solved!).
